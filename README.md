# IPL EDA

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the IPL dataset, analyzing player and team performances. It includes visualizations of "Man of the Match" awards, team wins, batting strategies, and more, using libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

### **IPL Data Analysis and Visualization**

This repository performs an EDA on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. It provides insights into various aspects of IPL matches, such as match results, player performances, toss winners, and trends over the seasons.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, and dropping unnecessary columns.
* **Player Performance Analysis**: Identify top players based on 'Man of the Match' awards.
* **Team Performance Insights**: Explore team performances in different scenarios (batting first vs. bowling first) and identify the most successful teams in each case.
* **Data Visualization**: Visualize analysis results with various plots such as:

  * Top players with the most "Man of the Match" awards.
  * Distribution of match outcomes based on runs or wickets.
  * Teams with the most wins after batting first or second.
* **Season-wise and City-wise Insights**: Analyze the number of matches played in each season and the cities where most matches are held.
* **Advanced Visualizations**: Includes detailed plots like pie charts, bar charts, and histograms to compare player and team performances.

#### **Data Source:**

The analysis is based on the IPL dataset, available from online sources such as **Kaggle** or IPL's official data. The dataset includes key columns like `match_id`, `date`, `team1`, `team2`, `winner`, `player_of_match`, and more.

#### **Libraries Used:**

* `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
* `matplotlib`: Static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization.
* `numpy`: Numerical computations and operations.

#### **Output:**

The analysis produces several visualizations, including:

* Bar plots for the top players with the most "Man of the Match" awards.
* Histograms showing the distribution of wins by runs and wickets.
* Pie charts illustrating the proportion of wins for teams batting second.

#### **How to Use:**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-eda.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have **Python** (version 3.7 or higher) installed. Then, install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```

3. ### **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   1. **Place the IPL dataset (`matches.csv`) in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook (`matches.ipynb`).**

   2. **Install necessary libraries** (if not already installed):

      Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

      ```bash
      pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
      ```

   3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

      Navigate to the directory where your `matches.ipynb` file is located:

      ```bash
      cd /path/to/your/folder
      ```

      Then, launch Jupyter Notebook:

      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```

   4. **Open the `matches.ipynb` file**:

      After Jupyter Notebook opens in your browser, click on the `matches.ipynb` file to open it.

   5. **Run the Cells**:

      * Click on a code cell and press `Shift + Enter` to run it.
      * Alternatively, you can run all cells at once by selecting **Run > Run All Cells** from the Jupyter toolbar.

### **Note:**

* Ensure the `matches.csv` file is in the same folder as your notebook (`matches.ipynb`) to load the data correctly.
* The notebook will generate various visualizations and outputs based on the data.
